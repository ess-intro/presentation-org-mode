* introduction to introduction to using ESS and Emacs org mode

this is where the source and some of the finished products for this
presentation exist.

it's not clear to me the build process would work on anyone else's
machine.  but, if so, ~make~ is run on the source files on a
developer's machine, and the resulting .html and .pdf files, in
=./artefacts/= are added to the repository and (when =git push= is
executed) uploaded to the github repository for access.

the beamer slides for the presentation are [[https://ess-intro.github.io/presentation-org-mode/artefacts/ess-org-beamer.html][here]] ([[https://ess-intro.github.io/presentation-org-mode/artefacts/ess-org-beamer.pdf][pdf]]).  a plain text
file, "suitable for experimentation" in Emacs, is [[https://ess-intro.github.io/presentation-org-mode/artefacts/ess-org-demo-expanded.org][here]].  A .html
version of that file is [[https://ess-intro.github.io/presentation-org-mode/artefacts/ess-org-demo-results.html][here]] ([[https://ess-intro.github.io/presentation-org-mode/artefacts/ess-org-demo-results.pdf][pdf]]).
