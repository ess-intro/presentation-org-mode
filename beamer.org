* structure of a code block

there are a few pieces of information org-mode needs to define a
block of code
- (optionally) a =name= for the block (to use to include the block's
  code in another block with [[noweb][noweb]], or to use the block's results as
  input to another block with [[variables][:var]].
- the language of the code in the block
- various arguments that define how the code interacts with its
  environment
- the source code itself

there are at least two ways of encoding the needed information:

** a source block

the most "normal" way of defining source code is with a /source
block/.

#+begin_src org
  ,#+begin_src R
    "hello, world"
  ,#+end_src
#+end_src

we use this form below.

** an /inline/ code block

in this form, the entire block can fit on one line (though multiple
lines are possible).

#+begin_src org
  src_R{"hello, world"}
#+end_src
